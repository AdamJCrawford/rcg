# RCG - ROS2 CMakeLists.txt Generator
A python script that automatically creates the CMakeLists.txt file that is required for building Ros2 projects. This has been tested using Windows Subsystem for Linux (wsl) and Windows 11. If it doesn't work for you, create a poll request will a version that does work, and I will merge the changes.
